Model Managers:- .objects is the default manager for all Models.
----
Managers for related objects = post.comments.filter()
create a class Extending models.Manager in models.py

Example
class PublishedManager(models.Manager):
    def get_queryset(self):
        return super(PublishedManager, self).get_queryset().filter(status='published')

>>> from Blog.models import Post
>>> Post.objects.all()
<QuerySet [<Post: Another title>, <Post: Second Post in Django>]>
>>> Post.published.all()
<QuerySet [<Post: Another title>]>
Only one was set published.

----------------------------------
add views to views.py get data using manager, then render using render()

Views refer to template to present data in user friendly fashion
now add Blog/templates/blog/post  directory with blog/base.html that will be inherited by other html files
https://docs.djangoproject.com/en/2.0/ref/templates/builtins/

use {% block <block_name> %} in base.html and override on inherited template
